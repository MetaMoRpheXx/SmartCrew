[h1]Overview:[/h1]

One of the things that irritates me is that my crews keeps sticking themselves on the teleporter all the time, which inspired me to create this mod despite of my really tight schedule. Now your crews are much more active than fiddling with your teleporter! (probably because your crew and the other bois at 2am are looking for [b]BEANS[/b]). This mod is for you if you don't like your crews looking like canned sausages. [i]The current state is stable but still, it is imperative that you [b]backup your saves[/b] before you start using this mod. If you happen to find a bug, please provide a link to your [b]starbound.log[/b] file, trust me, it'll benefit the both of us. I'll work it out on the best available weekend I got.[/i]

This is my first mod btw, go easy on me.

[h1]New Spice:[/h1]
    [list][*]Chemists, Engineers, and Mechanic will sometimes fail at their "experiment" so you might see them explode and do minuscule amount of AoE damage. They also work hard so they sweat... a lot.[/list]

[h1]Features:[/h1]
    [list][*]Improved crew behavior which makes them not hang around teleporter while on the ship.
    [*]Ship Crew members will actually "work" on certain items on ship depending on their role.
    [*]Internal schedule system so ship crew members will not always be anchored on the item they're assigned to.[/list]

Please note that crews will return to their default behavior if you're ship is not orbiting anything, which the mod is heavily dependent on. As far as I know, time doesn't "run" when your in the middle of space.

[h1]New Updates:[/h1]
    [list][*]Smart Crew is now running independent of the wander behavior.
    [*]More anchor items.
    [*]Much improved behaviors.
    [*]Lots of fixes.[/list]

For the changes to take effect, just drive your ship on another planet since the time resets every time the ship is driven on another place.
