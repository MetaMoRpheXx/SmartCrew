Overview:

One of the things that irritates me is that my crews keeps sticking themselves on the teleporter all the time, which inspired me to create this mod despite of my really tight schedule. Now your crews are much more active than fiddling with your teleporter! (probably because your crew and the other bois at 2am are looking for BEANS). This mod is for you if you don't like your crews looking like canned sausages. The current state is stable but still, it is imperative that you backup your saves before you start using this mod. If you happen to find a bug, please provide a link to your starbound.log file, trust me, it'll benefit the both of us. I'll work it out on the best available weekend I got.

Features:

    1.3
        • Crew members now have an internal daily schedule which means that they won't stick on the anchors permanently.
        • Individual crew's schedule have activities/tasks which is set every "ship day". This means that they have several activities/tasks everyday!
        • Current activities/tasks include "lounge", "roam", "sleep" and "work".
        • Lounging crews will make them sit around on chairs nearby.
        • Roaming crews will patrol your ship at random places.
        • Sleeping will vary from the crew's schedule defined at the config file (you may fiddle around the config if you know what you're doing and you're using the DRM Free version).
        • Working crews will go to their respective "anchors" doing their jobs that relates to their role.
        • You may see them reacting doing stuffs with a small chance of them doing monolouge along with it.

    1.2
        • Updated core functions to the latest Starbound Update.
        • Mostly code cleanup (independent files and patches) and some programming stuff. As for the rest of it, I won't go full nerd about the details.
        • Setup a Github repo (still private at the moment).

    1.1

        • Config file for you to place more crew jobs and/or items (anchor.config) OH YURR!
        • Chemists will stick around on any of these new items: Red, Blue and Green Flask (redflask), (greenflask), (blueflask).
        • Engineers will stick around on any Furnace or Inventor's Table upgraded or not.
        • Jannies will hang around on any Trash Bag (trashbag), Trash Can (trashcan) (hylotltrashcan) and Poop (poop).
