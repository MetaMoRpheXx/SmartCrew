Overview:

When the captain (you) don't like your crew moshing on the teleporter making ya'll look line a canned sardines. When also the captain (you again) want the crews to actually roam around your awesome ship. This Mod is now stable but still, it is imperative that you backup your saves before you start using this mod. If you happen to find a bug, please provide a link to your starbound.log file. I'll work it out on the best available weekend I got.
